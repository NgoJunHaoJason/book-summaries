## Chapter 2
### Agile

Agile is a combination of methodologies that can help teams adapt to the ever-changing nature of software projects.  
The Agile disciplines can be divided into two groups: process-oriented and technical-oriented.

**Process-Oriented Disciplines** help the team to focus on what is valuable to the business. Using these methodologies ensure the team is *building the right thing*.

**Technical-Oriented Disciplines** help the team to focus on the quality of the software, and to ensure the team is *building the thing right*.

**What it means to be Agile:**

We don't *do* Agile. Either we *are* Agile or we *are not*.

Agile methodologies are all about short feedback loops.  
When we react to some feedback, the act of reacting to new information is what makes us more agile.

Narrowing the feedback loop helps us to make problems visible sooner, allowing us to inspect and adapt quickly.  
Agile does not solve any problems; it exposes them.

**[Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/)**:

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.  
Through this work we have come to value:

> :heavy_check_mark: *Individuals and interactions* over processes and tools  
:heavy_check_mark: *Working software* over comprehensive documentation  
:heavy_check_mark: *Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation  
:heavy_check_mark: *Responding to change* over following a plan  

> That is, while there is value in the items onthe right, we value the items on the left more.

**The Agile Hangover**

> Many Agile projects are now, steadily and iteratively, producing crap code.

Many companies had a partial Agile transformation

They hired consultancies and Agile coaches to help them change their *process*.  
However, they got little help to get better at writing quality software.

As a result, companies started to realise that after all this transformation, they were still not delivering quality software fast enough.  
The new apps, built in an Agile fashion, were as complex and buggy as apps developed before the Agile transformation.

**Agile versus Software Craftsmanship**

Software Craftsmanship is *not* here to replace Agile; it is here to complement Agile.  
Agile helps companies to do the *right thing*. Software Craftsmanship helps developers and their companies to do the *thing right*.
